# Project title
                                       ** ATM MACHINE **

## Introduction
  This is a simple c language project whcih can be used to perform some bank related task , like withdraw, balance enquiry and deposit. I have used  C language to build the application. This is a cross paltform application. It can perform several operations using user input/choice. 
     
## Research

With increasing in population people are getting aware of creating bank accounts and its merit. So it becomes difficult to handle so many transaction by the employee and every coustomer has to wait too long for their turn to come. This software can help coustomer as well as bank employee also to get the basic work done without any timeloss and with less effort.

## FEATURES
 1.Transaction are made easy with simple steps
 
 2.System contains simple interface

## Challenges Faced and How Was It Overcome

1. building workflow, i sneaked through some youtube vidoes did some research and later my friend also hlped me.
2. managing github through vs code , learnt from the material provided by ltts.
3. writing test cases, learnt from seeing other repo and from the documentries provided by ltts.
4. debugging, learnt from youtube annd documentries provided by ltts.
